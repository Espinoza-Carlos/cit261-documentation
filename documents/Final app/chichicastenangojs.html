        The Chichicastenango market is one of the most colorful and exciting markets in Guatemala. It’s open on Sundays and Thursdays and is an interesting cultural experience for travelers.
The market is unusual in that it walks a fine line between cultural authenticity and unabashed tourism. It’s one of the few places in Guatemala that you’ll see local Mayans buying fruit alongside camera-toting tourists. Despite the fact that it has become a bonafide attraction, it hasn’t yet lost its zest or color.
